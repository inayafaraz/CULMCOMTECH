    <h1>Computers and Society</h1>
    <p>Here is a summary of the research assignment on Computers and Society:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact of Computer Use:</strong> Computers contribute to both positive and negative environmental changes. The increased use of technology leads to energy consumption and e-waste, but it also allows for more sustainable practices such as paper reduction and energy-efficient designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Effects:</strong> The positive effects include improved energy management systems, the reduction of paper use, and the ability to monitor and reduce environmental impacts through data collection and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Effects:</strong> Negative implications include the accumulation of electronic waste, energy consumption, and resource depletion due to manufacturing processes. The use of non-renewable resources in technology also poses long-term environmental challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving Environmental Impact Using Technology:</strong> Technology can be used to address these challenges by developing energy-efficient devices, promoting recycling programs, and innovating ways to reduce the environmental footprint of technology production and use.</li>
        <li><strong>Government and Community Solutions:</strong> Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and organizations such as the Electronic TakeBack Coalition work to promote recycling and reduce e-waste. Community initiatives include local recycling programs and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing energy consumption.</li>
